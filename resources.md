## Restrictions
* no access to file storage in bluemix 
* Next best thing would be to use a database (mysql)
* need to get photos from connect
* no access to photos from connect
* connect needs authorization
* sending requests would be very slow (individually)
* only solution (so far) is to store links in mysql database, load upon loading page BUT, permissions are needed for every single one
* another solution: don't get photos from connect. allow user to upload their own photos???
* get image by hashing e-mail to img?
